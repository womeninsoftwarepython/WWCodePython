With a world so centered around data, databases are an essential component for every developer. Python has a series of tools and libraries that help us manipulate and work with databases using our Python code.
In this series, we will be exploring the concepts, theory, and code behind multiple databases, both SQL and noSQL. The series will kickstart with a session on SQL concepts where we will tackle relational databases from A-Z. Then, we will use SQL with Python, and following that, we will jump to noSQL and explore two very popular databases, MonogoDB and Firebase.

<td colspan="3"><b>Fuzzy Search Algorithms: When and How to Use Them</b>
  <br><br>
Fuzzy Searching or approximate string matching is powerful because often text data is messy. For example, shorthand and abbreviated text are common in various data sets. In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible.
In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We will also discuss situations where it’s important to take into account the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within PostgreSQL.

<td colspan="3"><b>NLP Contextual Word Embeddings</b>
  <br><br>
Language representations and embeddings are an important step in developing machine learning models for Natural Language Processing. They are used for various language problems - Named entity recognition, POS tagging, sentiment analysis or language understanding and generation.

While traditional encodings to convert words and sentences to vectors were more intuitive, static embeddings were developed to incorporate a large vocabulary and corpus and eliminating the problem of sparse vectors. Since then, we’ve seen methods like word2vec, GloVe and now contextual embeddings are the norm - Elmo and now the state-of-the-art BERT.

In this talk, we’ll be covering how to create these embeddings with a focus on the most recent development - BERT, using the HuggingFace Transformers Library. We shall also cover how we can obtain BERT multilingual embeddings and how these embeddings are useful in a seq2seq network - which is a specific type of neural architecture to convert sequence of words or characters to another sequence

<td colspan="3"><b>Beyond Unit Tests: End to End Web UI Testing <br>(or <i>Testing Google forms, and how much I hate it</i>)</b>
  <br><br>

Unit tests are great, but they don’t catch all bugs because they don’t test features like a user -- but Web UI tests are complicated & notoriously unreliable. How can we write tests that do the job well? Never fear! :star2: :star2: :star2:

Let’s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest, & Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for **any** Web app:

- Using Selenium WebDriver like a pro
- Modeling Web UI interactions in Python code
- Writing “good” feature tests that are efficient, robust, and readable
- Deciding what should and should not be tested with automation

In this talk, we'll write one simple test together that covers DuckDuckGo searching.  Afterwards, you’ll know how to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for **any** Web app, including Django & Flask apps. Example code will be supplied on GitHub, as well as plenty of hands-on tutorials & resources to continue learning!

<td colspan="3"><b>Programming with Lambda, Map, Filter & Reduce</b>
  <br><br>

Most of the time, Python is seen as **object-oriented** -- a style where we model our data in the form of **classes**, **objects**, & **methods**.  But Python supports alternatives to that **OOP** paradigm -- **Functional Programming** being a very popular choice.  

Functions like **lambda** , **filter**,  **map**,  &  **reduce** fully support the Functional Programming style & in this live coding session we'll demonstrate how they can be effectively & efficiently used in our data analysis tasks.

**Here are some good reads on Functional Programming, to get your started :**
